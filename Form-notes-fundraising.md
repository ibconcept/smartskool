Part 2: Innovation
What problem is your solution solving?: Education is not learning. That's why I came up with a hybrid web application for schools, used by both teachers and students to incorporate peer-to-peer learning, self-paced learning, remote monitoring learning, and also integrated audio-visuals for learning and for technical assistants to manage students.
What is the factual evidence / proof available in support of the scope of the problem being addressed?: The school curriculum has been changing in Kenya but still hasn't been able to keep up with the digital times. That's why there is a dire need for such an enterprise app for education.
Describe your solution and how it works.: The app is an all-in-one school learning management system with mini-apps for various subjects and topics, where learners can learn at their own pace and peer review each other while being monitored by technical mentors.
What are the identified use cases for your solution?:
Learners can learn from anywhere, even with their parents' phones.
Technical mentors can monitor their students from anywhere, including homework and sending reminders.
The app can ease communication with in-app messaging.
Teachers can create new questions on the fields they want to test.
Why are other solutions inadequate?: Other solutions are not relevant since they are not based in this country. Solutions like Canvas LMS are too expensive. Some local solutions are similar to ABC games on Play Store and only cater to basic educational needs.
